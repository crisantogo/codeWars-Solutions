// Write a function that takes such collection and counts the points of our team in the championship. Rules for counting points for each match:
// if x > y: 3 points
// if x < y: 0 point
// if x = y: 1 point
// E - points(["1:0","2:0","3:0","4:0","2:1","3:1","4:1","3:2","4:2","4:3"]) , 30
// P - create a new variable whos value is an empty Array.
//   - iterate through the given Array using .map() method.
//   - for each iteration split the String.
//   - from the split string compare [0] & [2] according to the parameters
//   - push the value to empty Array.
//   - use the .reduce() method to determine the total number of points.

function points(games) {
    // your code here
